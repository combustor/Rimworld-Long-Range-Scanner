  <LongRangeMineralScanner.description>A lateral sensor unit used by researchers to detect resources across the planet. Scanning speed
depends on the operator's research ability. This sensor can be tuned to specific resource types, and with further research
may also find certain points of interest. It consumes a lot of electricity. If you find a resource, you'll have to travel to
collect it.</LongRangeMineralScanner.description>
